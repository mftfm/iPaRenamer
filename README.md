# iPaRenamer

**iPaRenamer** is a simple and powerful **automatic batch renaming tool** for iOS `.ipa` files.  
It reads all IPA files in a folder, extracts the **app name** and **version** from each app's `Info.plist`, and renames the files in a clean, consistent format:  

AppName_v<version>.ipa

Copy code

Duplicate IPAs are detected and moved to a `Duplicates/` folder to keep things organized.

üöÄ How to Use
Place all .ipa files in a folder.

Open terminal/command prompt in that folder (or provide path using -p).

Run the CLI:

bash
Copy code
python ipa_renamer_final.py -p /path/to/ipas
Optional: dry-run to see changes without renaming:

python ipa_renamer_final.py -p /path/to/ipas --dry-run
The program will automatically rename all IPAs, append the version (vX.Y.Z), and create a Duplicates/ folder if duplicates are found.

Optional GUI:
